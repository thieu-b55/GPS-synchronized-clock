To fit the glass dome, use an Arduino Mini Pro 5V version 

or 

ATMEGA328P chip supply voltage 5V

The LED matrix is not 3.3V compatible.

When using the ATMEGA328P chip, use the following settings:

Bootloader: "No bootloader"

Clock: "Internal 8MHz"

No impact on your finances

Ideal for Arduino beginners

Serial communication

I2C communication

SPI communication

Analog input
